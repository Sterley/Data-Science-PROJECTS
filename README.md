### Projet 1
Bases_IADS data: this corresponds to a binary classification problem. Bases_IADS_multiclasses data: this corresponds to a multiclass classification problem. For each data set, the 2 learning algorithms knn and perceptron are tested and compared. Experiments are explained.
### Projet 2
Application of several learning algorithms to highlight interesting results. Two problems are addressed: a supervised learning problem and an unsupervised learning problem.
### tme-01
